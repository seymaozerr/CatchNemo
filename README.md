# Catch The Nemo 

"Catch the Nemo" is a simple game that you can play on Android. The objective of the game is to catch the Nemos that appear on the screen and increase your score.

When you start the game, 12 Nemos will appear at different positions on the screen. You can increase your score by catching the Nemos within the given time limit. Once the time runs out and the game is completed, you can respond to the "Restart?" prompt that appears on the screen to either restart the game or exit it.

## Requirements
This project has been developed using Android Studio.

Enjoy the game :)
